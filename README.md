# Module 01

In this challenge, I was tasked with cleaning up some messy code and making a site work properly.

I used strictly HTML and CSS to complete this project, and I left comments throughout both my HTML and CSS to show changes I made. I then had to deploy my code to github for all to see. This is how the site should look. Thanks!
